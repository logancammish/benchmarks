2. (not implemented yet, but will be test amount)

Usage example: `$ ./evil-numbers -1`

Binaries: 
1. `evil-numbers.exe` - Windows x86-64
2. `evil-numbers` - Linux x86-64

Result: 
1. Average time - the time it takes to run each test on average in milliseconds (lower is better)
2. Overall time - the time it takes to run the program in milliseconds/seconds (lower is better)
3. Score - calculated score for comparison to others (lower is better)
