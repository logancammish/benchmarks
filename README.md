### A series of benchmarks for your computer, includes: 
* Evil Numbers
  
Evil Numbers is a CPU benchmark based on my answer to the Evil Numbers code golf (https://code.golf), it runs this check thousands, or even millions of times to determine your hardware capabilities. This test is availible in multi-threaded and single-threaded forms, through GUI and CLI interfaces and on Linux and Windows (x86-64) but can be compiled to any platform as it uses the `iced` Rust crate which is cross-compatible.

* RuggFeldman4

RuggFeldman4 is based on the Rugg/Feldman benchmarks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugg/Feldman_benchmarks) and similar to evil numbers, runs thousands or even millions of times a second. This test is availible in single-threaded form, through a GUI interface on Linux and Windows (x86-64) but can be compiled to any platform as it uses the `egui` Rust crate which is cross-compatible.
